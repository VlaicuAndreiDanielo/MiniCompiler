# MiniCompiler  

## 📌 Overview  
MiniCompiler is a simple compiler that performs basic operations and checks for **lexical, syntactic, and semantic errors**. It utilizes **ANTLR** for parsing and implementing the compiler's core functionality.  

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis** to identify errors in the code.  
- **Support for global variables and structures** for basic programming logic.  
- **Control structures**: Implements **if, while, and for** statements.  
- **Basic function calls** with a simple implementation.  
- **Token generation and display** for the given input code.  
- **Reads input from** `input.txt` and processes it through the compiler.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. The compiler reads **source code from `input.txt`**.  
2. It tokenizes the code, identifying valid tokens.  
3. Performs **lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis** to detect errors.  
4. Generates a structured representation of the parsed code.  
5. Allows **basic execution flow** using supported structures and function calls.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **C#** for implementing the compiler logic.  
- **ANTLR** for parsing and generating syntax trees.
